# AngularJS FilePond

A AngujarJS (yes I know that he is a bit old, but still people using it) component for [FilePond][filepond].

# Testing

For now I didn't wrote unit tests for this component, but there's a page for manual testing :)

`gulp debug`: Builds and start a server to test the application using the `index.html` file.
